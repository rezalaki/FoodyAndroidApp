# Foody Android App
This is an android project I developed in less than 24 hours, just a funny challenge with my friend.
I will add some other features and may migrate it to Jetpack Compose in future.
<br>
<br>
I used [spoonacular.com](http://spoonacular.com) API.
<br>
<br>
**Do NOT forget** to generate your own API_KEY and replace it with mine. You can find API_KEY variable in ```util\Constants```
